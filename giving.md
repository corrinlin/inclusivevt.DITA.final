# Office for Inclusion and Diversity Advancement

Virginia Tech students and alumni realize how powerful it can be when people and groups unite and put use their efforts together. Over recent years Virginia Tech has been on a good track of improvement, and we can’t let that be a waste. The Office for Inclusion and Diversity Advancement hopes to continue the improvement of the student body and educational experience here.  This goal is to be accomplished with three main methods.

The first method is the InclusiveVT Excellence Scholarship Fund, which hopes to allow higher quality of education to more students as well as less barriers. This fund will be directed towards recruiting unrepresented demographics into the student body. 

The second method is Beyond Boundaries Scholars, which aims at removing barriers for remarkable students and will match up to 65 donations of $3k/$4k/$5k to underrepresented groups during 2017. According to its official site, “we must act today. We must draw the world’s top students”. 

The third method is Endowed Scholarships in which they encourage the reader to create a new fund under the name of someone important to them. This office has a “growing commitment to reducing the loan burden upon our students” and they are hoping that it can more of a group effort to improve the lives of young students.
