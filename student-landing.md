# InclusiveVT for Students

There are several different programs and events throughout the year that students can get involved in. Here you will find information related to becoming involved with the movement as a current student.
* DiversityEdu is a course to educate students about bias and stereotypes within themselves and their community.
* The Strong Together Intiative is designed to raise awareness and facilitate action in an effort to promote diversity.
